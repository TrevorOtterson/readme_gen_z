## DESCRIPTION:
This application was made to make it easy for a developer to make a quality README.md. I created this template that you can just fill out in node.js and it will automatically update your README.md. The user can input: installation instructions, usage information, license(s) used, contribution rules, tests, and questions concerning their project. The question tab will link the users github, and email.
